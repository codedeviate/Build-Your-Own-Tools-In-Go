# Build-Your-Own-Tools-In-Go

This is the code for the tools in the course [Build You Own Tools In Go](https://codedeviate.github.io/aicollection/go-build-your-own-tools.html)

Since this is a work in prograss, the tools are not complete yet. I will update the status of each tool as they are completed.

The current status of each tool will show at the end of the tool name in the list below. The status icons are as follows:

**Current status**

| Status icon   | Description         |
| ------------- | ------------------- |
| :green_apple: | Working on macOS    |
| :apple:       | Problems on macOS   |
| :penguin:     | Working on Linux    |
| :chicken:     | Problems on Linux   |
| :window:     | Working on Windows  |
| :headstone:   | Problems on Windows |

If the checkbox is ticked then the tools is working on atleast one platform.

If there is no status icon, then the tool has not been started yet.
